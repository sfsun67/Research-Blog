# Research-Blog
Some ideas and research.

**My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (VLMs), World Models, and High-Quality Data to push the boundaries of cognitive reasoning, scene understanding, and efficient AI learning.**
- Smarter AI: Enhancing interpretability, alignment, and deep reasoning in LLMs
- Comprehensive AI: Advancing multimodal fusion for text, image, and video understanding
- Realistic AI: Developing world models to enable AI agents to simulate real-world scenarios
- Reliable AI: Improving data quality and augmentation strategies for better model performance
